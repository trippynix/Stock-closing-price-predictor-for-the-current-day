# Stock-closing-price-predictor-for-the-current-day
This is just my clg mini project where I tried to create model which predicts the closing price of the day if you put in the opening price of that day. 
I tried to make the code easier to understand but I think you may be puzzled as to why I did and put some lines of codes where it was unnecessary. 
Regardless if you don't understand certain parts, you can ping me on my social media account.
